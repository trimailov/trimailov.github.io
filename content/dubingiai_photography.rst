I wanted to do some night phtography in `Dubingiai <https://www.google.lt/maps/place/Dubingiai/@55.0643125,25.4471556,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x46dd7a7283665373:0x803ca84bdf84425d?hl=en>`_ for a long time. Yesterday weather loooked promising, with completely clear sky forecast from 22pm until around 3:30am. In the end it was not a succesful session, though there some things to learn and note to not repeat them.

Do not make focus stack with fast changing light (or do it very quickly)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We want to have best quality foreground as possible. It means we should lower our ISO quite a bit and lengthen the shutter (which at night can reach few minutes or more). If we make 3, 4 or more exposures which are longer than few minutes each, light (moon if we are talking about nightscapes) will change significantly and basically will make focus stack impossible due to moving shadows and slightly changing exposure.

Weather forecast can be not exact
---------------------------------

So do not waste time on shots you did not intended or dreamed about to take. With this shooting, clouds covered the sky at around 1:30am - 2 hours before it were forecasted. Thus during one long exposure shot, I've found another great composition to shoot, though I've missed it due to early overcast skies.
